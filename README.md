## Deployments

After a pull request is reviewed and merged to `master`, a Netlify deployment
will automatically build and publish the staging environment at
[lansingcodes-staging.netlify.com](https://lansingcodes-staging.netlify.com).

Once the staging environment has been reviewed, the `master` branch can be
promoted to the `production` branch with the following command:

``` sh
git fetch origin && git push --force origin origin/master:production
```

This will trigger another build and deployment by Netlify. The site will be
published to [www.lansing.codes](https://www.lansing.codes).

For both the staging and production sites, Netlify runs the command
`npm run build` to build the site and deploys the contents of the `/dist`
directory.

Staging is also configured to deploy _all_ branches, so creating a
pull request should create a temporary site where the changes can be previewed
before merging to `master`. Click on the _Details_ link next to the site check
labeled "netlify/lansingcodes-staging/deploy-preview" to see a live preview of
your changes.

The primary Humanity Codes account has administrator access to both Netlify
sites. Additional administrators can be added by invitation only.
